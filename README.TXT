System requirements
=====================
CPU - Intel 286 or higher (386 recommended)
RAM - 64K memory or higher
Disk requirements - flash drive or 1.44MB HD floppy disk required
Graphics - EGA or higher
You will also need software that can image the boot medium with the DavidDOS
image. I personally used the HxD hex editor for this purpose.

Steps to setup DavidDOS
=========================
1. Insert the boot medium into the computer.
2. Image the boot medium with the DavidDOS image using the imaging software of
your choice.
3. Insert the boot medium into the computer while it is off.
4. At bootup, press F12 or whatever key that gets you into the boot options
for your computer.
5. Select the DavidDOS medium for the boot options
6. If you followed the steps correctly you are now running DavidDOS

Software I used to make DavidDOS
=====================================
NASM - A free assembler
Microsoft Visual Studio - Code editor
Imdisk Virtual Disk driver - Allowed me to mount a virtual disk into Windows
VMware Workstation - Virtual machine software I used during development
HxD hex editor - Imaging and debugging
